# This is the server to communicate with in order to receive keys (--recv-keys)
# from, send keys (--send-keys) to, and search for keys (--search-keys)
# If exactly two keyservers are configured and only one is a Tor hidden service
# (.onion), Dirmngr selects the keyserver to use depending on whether Tor is  
# locally running or not. The check for a running Tor is done for each new
# connection.

# Provide a certificate for verification of the TLS certificates used with hkps
# (keyserver access over TLS).
# Get certificate from https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
# hkp-cacert ~/.gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
# ** The above setting specifying the use of sks-keyservers.netCA.pem is
# ** deprecated. Using the old setting prevents regular certificates from
# ** working. This comment remains for reference and to avoid confusion due to
# ** multiple sources on the web still advising to use the outdated configuration.
